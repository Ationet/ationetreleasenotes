### Issues fixed
The following incidents were corrected:
- Error when clearing filters in Current Accounts
- Validation error in sender email
- Error in filters, allows selecting the same vehicle/driver account more than once but they overlap each other.
- The data columns in Contracts Movements do not match with the ATIONET portal.
- When editing a vehicle and saving the changes, it does not redirect us to the menu of the same but keeps the pop-up in the vehicle view.
- When editing a fleet, the complete Classification field is not shown as seen in the list.



## Next Features in BETA (Dec 30, 2024)

**New "Requested Identification" window**

A new window will be added to the Fleets section that will allow users to view the status of requested Idntifications and allow them to cancel or confirm requests

**Implementations during the end-of-year period**

As usual, deployments in the Production environment will be restricted towards the end of the year. This is the last update of the console for the year. The next scheduled date is January 15.

During this period, the rest of the activities and processes will continue as normal, except that deployments in the Production environment will not be carried out unless it is necessary to resolve an incident that limits the operation of our clients.

If you have any questions regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact our support team.
