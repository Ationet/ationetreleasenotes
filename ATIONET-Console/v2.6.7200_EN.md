# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7200

## PROD Deployment (Oct 08, 2025)

### New section: **"Transaction Submission Status"**
Starting with this version, a new view will be available for the Network profile only if the "Transaction Reporting" functionality is enabled in the network settings.

From this view, users will be able to see the status of the transactions that are sent to an external ERP for traceability purposes, as well as have the ability to resend transactions at any time.
