## PROD Deployment (Oct 08, 2025)

### New section: **"Transaction Sending Status"**
Starting with this version, a new view will be available for the Network profile only if the "Transaction Reporting" functionality is enabled in the network settings.

From this view, users will be able to see the status of the transactions that are sent to an external ERP for traceability purposes.
