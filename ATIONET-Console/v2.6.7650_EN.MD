# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7650

## Deployed to PROD (Feb 11, 2026)

### Site Enablement / Disablement
As part of this new update, network administrators will be able to define whether a site is active for operations, ensuring that transactions can only be processed at available stations.
Two new properties have been added to the Site entity:

- Active: defines whether the site is enabled for transactions
- Cease of Operations: date field (optional) used to indicate when the site stopped operating

These properties are now available in the Create, Edit, and Site Details views.
Additionally, the Site List view now includes:
- A new column indicating whether the site is active or inactive.
- The Cease of Operations property within the extended view.
- A new Active filter with options All, Yes, and No, set to Yes by default.
The new properties are also recorded in the audit log and included in the Site List Excel export.
As part of this enhancement, the authorizer will prevent transactions from being processed at inactive sites, returning the corresponding decline message.

### Visibility of Ongoing Identification Requests
With this update, users can now view ongoing identification requests directly from the Vehicle and/or Driver Details screen when they have not yet been marked as received by the company.

This new section allows users to:
- Quickly review identification requests associated with the vehicle or driver.
- Access the request details through a hyperlink available in the listed order number.
This enhancement improves traceability and simplifies tracking the status of requested identifications


### City and State in Price and Contract Modifier Reports
The Prices and Contract Modifiers report generation process has been enhanced to include two new columns: City and State.

Both fields will be displayed in the Excel file next to the site description, providing greater geographic context and improving data analysis.

### Fixed Issues
The following issues have been fixed:
- The bulk actions button list was displayed out of position in the Drivers section.
- An issue was fixed where downloading the Excel file or printing the vehicle activity details caused the system to remain loading without executing any action.
- Performance improvements were implemented for user export processes.
