# ATIONET Console (Web portal) - v2.6.7150

## PROD Deployment (Sep 24, 2025)

### Changes in Identification Request Cancellation

#### 1. Cancellation as Network Admin
**New by Network**: It will be possible to cancel the request in the state [Requested - In Production - In Transit], and the identification will remain in the canceled state.

**New by Company**: It will be possible to cancel the request in the states [Requested - In Production], where the order will remain in the canceled state, but the identifiers will return to the “Available” state.  
It will be possible to cancel the request in the state [In Transit], where the order will remain in the canceled state, and in this case, a pop-up will be displayed to choose the state to which the identification belonging to the order should be set.

#### 2. Cancellation as Company Admin
**New by Company**: As an exclusive exception for identification whose model is “Assignable,” it will be possible to cancel the request up to the “Requested” state. This cancellation will return the identification to the “Available” state instead of the “Canceled” state.  
The purpose of this change is to allow the Network to reuse identification that may have been requested due to user errors.

### New Filter for Identification "Without Company"

A new filter option is added to allow filtering identifications that are not assigned to any company in order to know how many are available to request.

### Change in the flow of "Assignable" Identification Requests

When a request is made by the company, if the selected identifier model is assignable, the system will assign free and available identifications within the system instead of generating them.

Additionally, for orders whose identifications belong to an “Assignable” model, it will now be possible to set them to the “In Transit” state without necessarily going through the “In Production” state, making the latter an optional step.
