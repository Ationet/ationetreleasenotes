# ATIONET Console (Web portal) - v2.6.7100

## Deploy in PROD (Sep 10, 2025)

## New Feature: Bulk Request of Fleet Identifiers  

Network admins (And derived roles) can now generate bulk requests for identifiers of any type or model, without the need to associate them with a company/contract.  
This feature is included in the **Requested Identifications** section of the Fleet module.

In the **New Request** menu, two options are available:  
- **Request Fleet Identifiers** (new)  
- **Request Custom Fleet Identifiers** (existing)

This new request allows you to:  
- Define type, model, program, and quantity.  
- Optionally define Contract and/or Company.  
- Generate an order with *Requested* status.  
- Send the order to production, notifying the corresponding provider.  

In addition, a new bulk action is added: **“Set as Available”**, which will only apply to requests originated as *“New by Network”*. With this action, once the physical identifiers have been received, they can be marked in the system as available so that companies can request them.

## Identifiers with Sequential PAN  

A new configurable property has been added to **Identifier Models**, allowing identifiers to be generated with a sequential PAN number. When enabled, the **PAN Code** field appears which allows to define the start of the sequence.

For example: a model with BIN range `12345`, Sequential PAN enabled, and a PAN Code `99`, when requesting 3 identifiers will generate:  
- `123459900000000001`  
- `123459900000000002`  
- `123459900000000003`  

## Improvements in Gift Card Views  

### **Requested Cards** View  
A new **Value** column has been added, which shows the original value requested per order. For example: if a card of $10 is requested, the column will display **$10**.  

### **Cards** View  
A new column has been added with the original value for which each gift card was issued, along with its current balance.  

### New Request Order Filter in **Cards**  
A new filter has been added to retrieve gift cards according to the **Request Order Number** from which they were generated.

## Fixed Issues and Improvements  

The following issues have been fixed:  
- Contracts were not displayed in the company’s current account movements.  
- Unhandled behavior when a sub-account associated with scattered product contracts did not have sufficient balance to cover the total operation.
