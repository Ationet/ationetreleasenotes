# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7700

## Deployed to PROD (Feb 25, 2026)

### Company Contract Movements Report
A new Company Contract Movements report is now available that allows to view contract balance deposits and withdrawals.

Unlike the “Company Current Account” view, which allows users to query one contract at a time, this report lets you see movements of all the available contracts in a single query.

This report can be exported in Excel or PDF format, depending on user preference.

### Business Rules Unlinking When Marking Vehicles as Obsolete
When a Company Admin marks a vehicle as obsolete, all rules associated with that vehicle will be automatically unlinked.  
This prevents confusion by ensuring that rules are not shown as applied to vehicles that are no longer operational.
