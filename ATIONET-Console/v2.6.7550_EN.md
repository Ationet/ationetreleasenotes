# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7550

## Deployed to PROD (Jan 14, 2026)

### When importing vehicles/drivers with identification requests, if the entity already exists, the identification request will still be processed
Previously, during the vehicle import process, if a vehicle already existed in the system, it was not processed, regardless of whether an identifier request was present.

As of this version, in the driver and/or vehicle import processes, when identifier requests are included and the record already exists in ATIONET, the system will proceed with the corresponding identifier request, provided that there is no other identifier already assigned to that vehicle for the requested contract.

Additionally, in the notification email indicating whether the process was successful, the requested identification will be listed along with the rest of the information.

### Fixed Issues
The following issues have been fixed:
- Tooltips in Voucher creation
- Error in mandatory fields when generating a identifications requests
- Issue where dry products sales with vouchers do not generate sub-account movements in the current account
- Performance improvements in vehicle/driver imports
- Error when importing a dry products quota rule
- The "Show only active" checkbox was not saved in custom filters
- It was possible to create a Merchant and Company with special characters in the name, even though input validation indicated they were not allowed
- It was possible to enter invalid characters in the location code
- The "Ok" button was positioned much lower than the Payment Gateways confirmation
- It was possible to enter letters in a numeric field in Rules
- Incorrect pagination in the External Charges module
- The "Clear filters" button was not working correctly in the Terminals, Programs, and Identifiers views
