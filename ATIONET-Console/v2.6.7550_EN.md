# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7550

## Deployed to PROD (Jan 15, 2025)

### When importing vehicles/drivers with identification requests, if the entity already exists, the identification request will still be processed
Previously, when importing vehicles, if the vehicle already existed, it was not processed regardless of whether there was an identifier request or not.

As of this version, during the import process of vehicles/drivers, if identification requests are submitted and the entity already exists in ATIONET, the identification request will still be processed, provided that there is no other identification assigned to the same vehicle/driver for the requested contract.

Additionally, in the notification email indicating whether the process was successful, the requested identification will be listed along with the rest of the information.

### Fixed Issues
The following issues have been fixed:
- Tooltips in Voucher creation
- Error in mandatory fields when generating a identifications requests
- Issue where dry products sales with vouchers do not generate sub-account movements in the current account
- Performance improvements in vehicle/driver imports
- Error when importing a dry products quota rule
- The "Show only active" checkbox was not saved in custom filters
- It was possible to create a Merchant and Company with special characters in the name, even though input validation indicated they were not allowed
- It was possible to enter invalid characters in the location code
- The "Ok" button was positioned much lower than the Payment Gateways confirmation
- It was possible to enter letters in a numeric field in Rules
- Incorrect pagination in the External Charges module
- The "Clear filters" button was not working correctly in the Terminals, Programs, and Identifiers views
