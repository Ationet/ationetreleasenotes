# ATIONET Console (Web portal) - v2.6.6900

## Deploy in PROD (Jul 16, 2025)


### Gift Card Label
Starting from this version, a new field called "Label" will be added to gift cards. This field, which by default will have the same value as the PAN, can be modified by administrators to assign a custom name or identifier to each card.

<br>

This functionality is especially useful, as it will allow for more precise searches using the label filter.
