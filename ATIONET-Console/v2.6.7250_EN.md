# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7250

## PROD Deployment (Oct 22, 2025)

### Remote Monitoring
Starting with this new version, there will be a new view called **“Gateway”**, which will allow network admins to see the status of Local Agent and certain types of terminals that support the messaging.

From here, users will be able to see the latest report from the service or terminal and in acse that the system has not received any updates for more than 5 hours then the terminal will be displayed as **offline**.  
Additionally, it will display the installed version, the site location, and the date of the last report.

### Loyalty Discount Rules by Transaction or Unit
Starting with this version, the Loyalty discount community will have two new types of discount rules available:  
- **Fixed per transaction:** A discount applied to the total of the transaction.  

  For example, if there is a $3 discount and the transaction amount is $10, then the final amount will be $10 - $3 = $7.
  
- **Fixed per unit:** A discount applied for each liter, gallon, kilogram, or product unit.  

  For example, if there is a $0.1 per liter discount and the transaction is 20L, the total discount will be $0.1/L * 20L = $2.

### Voucher Encryption
In the **Identification Models** section, voucher types will now include a new checkbox labeled **“Encrypt file”**.

When this option is enabled, the downloaded PDF file of the voucher will be encrypted, requiring users to enter a password to visualize it.
