# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7400

## PROD Deployment (Dec 03, 2025)

### Vouchers in the “Program” filter of Fleet Transactions
In the Fleet -> Transactions section, it is now possible to filter by voucher programs,  
allowing users to obtain information about transactions made using this method.

## Fixed Issues and Improvements
The following issues were corrected:  
- The “Gateway” view is not available for homebase and retail.
- The default “Barcode” selection when printing vouchers has been removed.
- When attempting to release an identification that has an oustanding transaction, a pop-up notification will now appear informing this.
- When switching contracts during voucher creation, if the contract does not return a balance, the available balance field is not cleared.
- Overlapping error in the icon with message in the confirmation pop-up for resending transactions to ERP.
- Voucher details weren't opening in the audit log.
- Two identifications were being generated during driver creation instead of one.
