# ATIONET Console (Web portal) - v2.6.6650

## Deploy in PROD (May 7, 2025)

## Generating Contingencies from Exceptions
Contingency Generation from Exceptions
Starting with this version, from the bulk actions in the Exceptions view, users will be able to select one or more transactions to create contingencies using their data.
These contingencies will be available in the Contingencies view to be edited, approved, and/or rejected, providing users with a simpler and more efficient way to create contingencies in bulk.

### Fixed Incidents
The following issues have been fixed:
- Error in the Excel export of vouchers that ignored the established filters.
- Error when exporting vouchers by contract to Excel.
- The "Site" and "Fuel" fields in merchant contracts were not being indicated as mandatory when saving changes.
- The confirmation pop-up when releasing identifiers did not match the ATIONET aesthetic.
