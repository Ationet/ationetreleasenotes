# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7450

## PROD Deployment (Dec 17, 2025)

### Bulk rule import
Users with the Company Admin role now have the option to create rules in bulk through an import template.

A new button has been added that allows users to request an import Excel file via email for each type of rule. This Excel file can be modified and then imported into the portal to create multiple rules at once.

### Improvements to the “ Terminal Connectivity Monitor ” Section (Previously Known as Gateway)
This section, previously called “Gateway” has been renamed to “Terminal Connectivity Monitor” to better describe its functionality. Additionally, it has been moved from the “Fleet” category to “Administration.”

A new filter, “Has Site?”, was added, allowing users to filter terminals that do not have an associated site, such as older Local Agent versions.

Visual improvements were also made to the terminal details section, separating information related to the site (such as its location) from other terminal specific details.

The following issues were corrected:
- Various translation errors  
- Various spelling errors  
- “City” field incorrectly marked as mandatory when creating or editing a company
