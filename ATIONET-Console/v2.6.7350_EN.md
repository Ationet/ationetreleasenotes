# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7350

## Deploy to PROD (Nov 19, 2025)

### Batch Update for Vouchers

Starting with this new version, a new batch action feature will be available in the vouchers view, allowing mass enabling or disabling of vouchers.

Additionally, there is now an option to download and upload an Excel template that contains voucher PAN information and allows changing their “Active” status (Yes/No).
