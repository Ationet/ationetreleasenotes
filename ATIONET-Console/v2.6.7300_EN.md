# ATIONET Console (Web Portal) - v2.6.7250

## Deploy to PROD (Nov 05, 2025)

### Anonymous Identifications for Loyalty

Starting from this new version, there will be a new option in the Loyalty communities to support anonymous identifications.  
If this option is enabled, when performing a mass Loyalty identification request, there will be an option to indicate that these identifications will be anonymous.

These anonymous identifications don't need to be associated with a driver or vehicle to be used.
