# ATIONET Console (Web portal) - v2.6.6050

## Deploy in PROD (Nov 20, 2024)

### New Validity option for Rules
As of this update, the NW Admin and NW Company Admin roles will have a new option to set a validity for ALL the types of rules using the “Date From" and “Date To" fields. With this feature, users can configure a date range in which the rule will be active, while outside of that range the rule will be automatically deactivated.
This feature allows users to schedule and manage rules with greater precision, adapting them to specific periods according to their needs.

**Important:** This feature is not yet enabled while in off-line mode; however, we’re working to have it released in a new Local Agent deployment

From this new update, NW Admins will be able to filter contingencies by the “Invoice Number” in order to facilitate their searches.
Also, when exporting the contingency’s spreadsheet, users will be able to see a new column that shows the “Invoice Number” data

**API Native "Transactions Custom Fields Download" (948)**
Starting November 20th, a change will be implemented in the production environment for the API Native method “Transactions Custom Download” (948) to enforce the use of pagination in the requests sent.

Although this functionality was already in place, starting from that date, it will be validated that the number of requested records does not exceed 1,000, in which case the request will be rejected
