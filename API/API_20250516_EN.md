# ATIONET API changes 

## Deploy in PROD (May 21, 2025)

### New parameter to prevent user notifications in the ResetUserAtionetPassword method
A new optional boolean parameter called "**SendNotificationMails**" has been added to the **ResetUserAtionetPassword** API method.
If set to true, users will not receive the email notifying them of the password change.

### New validations in the Gift Card activation method
The Gift Card activation method (ActionCode 802) now includes the following validations:

- If a card is already active, it will return the error message "Card already active"
- If a single-use card has already been used, it will return the error message "Card already used"
- If the card is expired, it will return the error message "Card expired"
