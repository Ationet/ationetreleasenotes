# ATIONET Console (Web portal) - v2.6.6100

## Deploy in PROD (Dic 4, 2024)

### Register counter in Rules

Since this update, a counter has been added to the “Apply To” section of rules that indicates the number of entities that this rule will apply to.
This new counter is available for all different types of entities (vehicles, drivers, fleets, sites, etc.) and will help users know the impact of the rule.

### Add fuel name to the mass fuel rule update Excel

Starting with this new version, users with the NW Company Admin role will be able to see in the Excel for the mass update of Fuel Rules, in the “definitions” sheet, a list with the fuel codes along with their names, thus allowing users to map the fuels

### Fixed Incidents
- The following incidents were corrected:
- Error when trying to edit or create contingencies
- Information in English was displayed in the Report Requests -> Detailed Rules report even though the report was in Spanish
- Expired modifiers were displayed in the "Contract Prices and Modifiers" report.
- The "validity" information was not displayed in the audit log when updating a rule.
- The release, activation or deactivation of identifiers was not being carried out correctly.
- Excel of the 'Quota Rules' report was displayed without information



## Next features in BETA (Dic 2, 2024)

**New role based on en CGInterfaceAPI**
A new role will be created based on CGInterfaceAPI, which instead of filtering by Company Group (CodGrupo), will allow filtering by the companies that are enabled
 
**New parameter for the API Rest Users to not notify the users**
This API will have a new optional parameter, which will allow you to indicate whether you want to receive the welcome email to ATIONET or with the user's password when a new role is created, edited or assigned through the Rest API.

**New “offline support” check in identifier models**
A new check will be added so that identifiers of a certain model cannot be used offline by Local Agent.

**Legibility in vehicle-driver assignment**
In the vehicle details section, a more organized view was displayed in the driver assignment section to make it easier to see. The same applies to drivers.

**Massive rules update**
The Company Administrator will be allowed to bulk modify rule assignments to vehicles and drivers, through the existing bulk updates functionality.

**Implementations during the end-of-year period**

As is customary, implementations in the Production environment will be restricted towards the end of the year. The last Production deployment date will be December 18, with the next scheduled date set for January 15.

During this period, all other activities and processes will continue as usual, except that no implementations will be made in the Production environment unless it is necessary to address an incident that impacts our clients’ operations.
