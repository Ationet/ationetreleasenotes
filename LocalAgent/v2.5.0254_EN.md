# Local Agent V2.5.0254

## Release date: Dec 19, 2024

### Rules Validity in offline transactions
Starting with this new version, the validity periods configured for ALL types of rules using the "Date from" and "Date to" fields from the ATIONET portal can be considered in Offline transactions.
As a reminder, users can define a date range in which the rule will be active, while outside of that range, the rule will be automatically deactivated.
