# Local Agent v2.6.0001

## Release Date: Oct 31, 2025

### [Guide to Install or Update to Version 2.6.0000 or Higher](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Local%20Agent%20Installation%20Guide-EN.md#installation-version-260000)

### Remote Update
Starting from this version, the service includes a new automatic remote update process.  
This allows installations to be updated automatically whenever a new version is available, eliminating the need for manual user intervention.

This ensures that all the sevices remain up to date with the latest improvements, fixes, and system optimizations.

### Remote Monitoring Tab
Starting with this new version, there will be a new view called “Gateway”, which will allow network admins to see the status of Local Agent and certain types of terminals that support the messaging.

From here, users will be able to see the latest report from the service or terminal and in acse that the system has not received any updates for more than 5 hours then the terminal will be displayed as offline.
Additionally, it will display the installed version, the site location, and the date of the last report.

### New Parameter in the Installation File
In the 'install.config' file used to install the service, there is a new parameter called 'Terminal Code'.  
This must be filled with the same code as a terminal in ATIONET (Administration -> Terminals / Controllers) and will be used by the system to differentiate each service instance.
