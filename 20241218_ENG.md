# ATIONET Console (Web portal) - v2.6.6150

## Deploy in PROD (Dec 18, 2024)

### "Not Support Offline" check in identifier models
With this update, a new option is added to the identifier models to decide whether or not these identifiers can be used offline by Local Agent.

This check will be disabled by default, which will make it work the same way as it does now, regardless of whether it is used offline or online.

### Improved readability in vehicle-driver assignment
Starting with this new version, in the editing/viewing view of a vehicle, in the Drivers section, the “Drivers” column will be divided into 2, one for the driver's name and another for the code in order to display this information in a more legible way.

Likewise, in the driver's editing/viewing view, in the Vehicles section, a division of the "vehicles" column into 2 will be shown, one for the vehicle code and another for the plate.

### Fixed Incidents
The following issues were fixed:
- The master fuel name was displayed instead of the flag in the "Contract Prices and Modifiers" report.
- Incorrect information was displayed in the detailed daily rate rule report of daily quota.
- Inconsistencies in the display of ATIONET inventory and the tank data were corrected.

**Implementations during the end-of-year period**

As usual, deployments in the Production environment will be restricted towards the end of the year. This is the last update of the console for the year. The next scheduled date is January 15.

During this period, the rest of the activities and processes will continue as normal, except that deployments in the Production environment will not be carried out unless it is necessary to resolve an incident that limits the operation of our clients.

If you have any questions regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact our support team.
